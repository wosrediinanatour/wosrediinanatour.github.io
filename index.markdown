Dear reader! Welcome to my new home page. This site had been intended to be a blog where I post new articles on a regular base. Due to being short of time, I tidied up this page and made it more maintainable by moving to Jekyll/Github. Who knows, maybe there will be some new posts soon...

Short posts and re-tweets are on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/wosrediinanatour).
