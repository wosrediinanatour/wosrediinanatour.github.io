Developing under Linux, TMUX and VIM are hard to beat. For Python and C++, I maintain dotfiles [here](https://github.com/wosrediinanatour/dotfiles). The main features are as follows:
 - Integration of VIM, TMUX, and GIT
 - Use of a language server protocol (CCLS)
 - Minimized dependencies
 - Minimized numbers of VIM plugins
